# Hello !!!

This is my newest personal portfolio crafted with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
Feel free to clone it and use it just change my personal information.

## Notes

- Analytics and Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- You can update metadata and social links in 'app/data.tsx'.
- If you modify the routes, you need to update 'app/sitemaps.ts' for SEO to work properly.
- If build fails, you need to disable rules in ESLint: [ESLint.config] (https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint).
